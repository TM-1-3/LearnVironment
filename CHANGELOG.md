# Sprint 1
### We implemented the following user stories:
- As a game developer I want to be able to browse all games so that I can see what other developers have made and innovate. [#28](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2024-25/2LEIC13T3/issues/28)
- As a student I want to be able to play any game and learn, even if it wasnâ€™t assigned by my teacher. [#29](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2024-25/2LEIC13T3/issues/29)
- As a student I want to be able to view my mistakes so that I can easily revise those materials. [#40](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2024-25/2LEIC13T3/issues/40)
